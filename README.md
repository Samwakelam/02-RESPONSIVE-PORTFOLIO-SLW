# Sam's Portfolio

## Description

This project has been created as a draft of my portfolio. It is version 1; designed to test my html, css, and Bootstrap skills. 
The intention of my Portfolio is to showcase my reecent acheivements and quality of work to prospective employers, but also demonstrate my ability and skills to people looking at the web page. It is designed to be an online CV/ Porfolio. 

I have used the Usage section of this  README to define the problems I encountered from the point at which I asked for help from my online tutor; and the methods used to overcome them. 
The Problems this has solved are: 

I have been able to develope and learn more complicated css, practise the use of predefinned css and isolate elements within the coding to add my own personality and style. I have specifically learnt how to combine methods to create a tabbed navigation system with the use of both images and words as toggleable prompts for different information to show as and when called for.

It has tested my troubleshooting abilities and problem-solving capabilities, although I have had to ask for help to refine and define better methods to acheive the result I was chasing. This has helped me to furhter understand where I need to continue to study, and where I can smooth out my code for future drafts and other webpages. 

My project stands out using navigation methods throughout the website, not just confined to the Nav Bar.

## Installation

The major frame work that I have utilised for this project is Bootstrap. 

## Usage

This part of the README defines the project from the point at which I asked for help with underlying issues I had encountered. My online Tutor helped me to clean up the code and better display my pages. 

 ### Index Page
 ![Index page about sam](assets/images/screenshots/homeSam-min.JPG)

Im pretty happy with this one in general, my side tabs are pretty cool, I used .tab-pane to get it to flick through. Some parts need to be styled, and that's my overall frustration is how to target and override the bootstrap stuff. 
I'm not sure how to isolate the features, I'm trying to use DEV tools to identify the classes and elements. I seem to be struggling to change the colour of the Navbar. 
 This however is not my immediate priority. 

The tabs on the side; the issue is getting them to compress with the page as I shrink it, this is a media queries thing. I have not investigated that too far at this stage of development, just fighting to get the page to work.

 This I am pleased with. I would like to style the tabs if I have time. I need to focus on Media Quiries first.

I cannot get the cards to "fall nicely", again having issues keeping the pictures in the containers, I feel like I have forced this page rather than understanding the right way to do this. (desperately trying to ignore design too much at this stage) I have got it to spread evenly in three far spread columns. 

 ### Contact Page 
 ![Contact Page ](assets/images/screenshots/Contact-min.JPG)

 1.	On the surface this looks okay (if not kind of boring) but again feel like it is a forced hopeful rather than actually working....

2.	I want to reduce the margin I think between the buttons, in theory a simple task, but in reality it took me ages to replicate that with the paragraph tags in the main body, using the same instructions for the div containers, but they don't seem to want to keep the shapes and sizes I give them.  Somehow, I stumbled on the solution to this, I do not feel like it is right and consequently do not want to change it.

I have managed to change the little buttons padding etc, as you would expect. It all seems to be as you would expect, so I am not sure what I created in the first instance. 

I have fixed the footer to the bottom of the screen, but not without faults, the rest of the content does not follow it. and some of the content does not scoll above it. 

As you can see the form css has interfeared with the aside and nav bar. i have left comments in the css here. I resolved this by targeting the form input attribute selectors only.

Next problem, the form doesnt scroll all the way past the footer.... 


 ### Fashion Page

This one is a nightmare.

The aside, I am trying to replicate what I did in index with the side tabs, but with logos like in contact.

I am either struggling to get floats and blocks to work and not have everything cluster together, or the pictures will not go into the containers, or I can’t put a nav-panes instruction to it.

The cards, either squash the photos, or are massive on the page and I have tried CSS and class and id to try and "force it" but for some reason whatever I try is just messing up and I’m losing patience with it. I just do not seem to understand why it is not doing what I think I am telling it. It does not seem to follow any logic patterns at all.

 ### Building Page
 ![Index page about sam](assets/images/screenshots/building-min.JPG)

This Page I completed having researched CSS image gallery, as an alternative to the cards as a presentation. I needed to demonstrate Bootstrap but also I wanted to test some other theories. This seems to have gone to plan.
